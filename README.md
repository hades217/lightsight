===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keystonejs/keystone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keystonejs/keystone)

[lightsightJS](http://jiangren.com.au) is a powerful Node.js content management system and web app framework built on [express](http://expressjs.com) and [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com). Keystone makes it easy to create sophisticated web sites and apps, and comes with a beautiful auto-generated Admin UI.

## lightsight 1.0 Beta 1 

lightsight is forked from [KeystoneJs](http://keystone.com) and add more features to CMS. We tend to work a new CMS because KeystoneJS has been suspended for more than one year. As there are many projects based on KeystoneJS, there is limitation to the KeystoneJS which pushes us to develop a new CMS to meet our requirement. Improvements include:

* Multiple Permission system 
* Better for Chinese
* Custom Admin UI for different tenants
* Faster first loading adminUI
* Support for Alicloud
* lightsight inherited all features from Keystone(4.0-beta8)

Please try out the beta and let us know what you think:

```
npm install --save lightsight
```
